Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.  Your new Empire?  Don't make me kill you.  Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic to democracy!  If you're not with me, you're my enemy. Only a Sith deals in absolutes. I will do what I must. You will try.
